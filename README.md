# Intro-to-Deep-Learning-and-Keras

Install tensor flow by following: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac

Install keras using the pdf attached. 

After installing, follow along with the keras example to make sure keras is functioning properly.

Read the What are tensors document and then follow along with keras with this example: https://blog.thoughtram.io/machine-learning/2016/11/02/understanding-XOR-with-keras-and-tensorlow.html The XOR problem is used to illustrate the need for multilayer neural networks (that some things need more than 1 layer)
